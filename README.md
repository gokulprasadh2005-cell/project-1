Future Improvements
Backend Integration: Connect booking form to a database using PHP, Node.js, or Firebase. Payment Integration: Add online payment options for room reservations Dynamic Content: Load rooms and spa services dynamically from a database. Animations & Transitions: Enhance SPA transitions using libraries like GSAP. Accessibility: Improve accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation. SEO Optimization: Add meta tags and optimize images for search engines.
